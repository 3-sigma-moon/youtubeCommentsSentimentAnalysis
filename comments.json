It was pure torture for close to a year. I have to laugh at people who think Peterson becoming dependent on benzos somehow discredits him but imo it actually fortifies his teachings. He was self aware enough to realize he had a problem and then wad strong enough to remedy the problem. I'm not a disciple of his and there are plenty of things I disagree with but I respect the man and enjoy listening to his logic.", "I work for a company that helps people come off of medications.  We have known for more than ten years that a Benzo withdrawal was comparable or even worse than a heroin withdrawal.  If you quit cold turkey you may go into shock and cardiac arrest.  One of the saddest client experiences was when a mother and her 8 year old came to us.  His school counsellor mentioned that he was having problems with his attention and he seemed anxious in class.  The boy was prescribed 3 different medications and two, TWO were benzos.  Turns out that he wasn't sleeping well because he was being bullied by some older boys and he was fearful of recess and lunch because that's where they would corner him and that's all he could think about.  This child had to go through the withdrawals that an adult should never have to experience, because some school counsellor thought that he needed drugs instead of looking for the root cause of the anxiety in the first place.

I had my own room, but on both sides of the room I shared walls with one guy in his 30's coming off of benzos on one end and the other an older gentleman coming off opiods. 4 out of 7 nights I stayed awake, listening to what I can only describe as pure agony, screaming, crying, begging, praying, wishing for death etc, until, eventually, they'd either pass out or just go shower and go on about the day as if nothing happened.

It was because of listening to him I started reading great thinkers like Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Jung, Frankel, Nietzsche, etc. Those works opened my eyes to a deeper part of me that made a lot of the pain I was, and am feeling, bearable. I was a cynical atheist suffering from ptsd. I saw absolutely zero value in religious teachings at all. Now, after looking deeper, I see that I was arrogant for thinking I could put myself in a position to judge ANY teachings if I was not able to judge my own actions and take accountability for them. \n\nWhether or not people agree with him or any of the ideas he presents is not for me to judge.

Thank you Dr. Peterson", "It\u2019s crazy. I was on benzodiazepines for about a year. I started taking them for sleep trouble. One of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve ever made in my life. I found myself completely dependent on them almost immediately and they only compounded my problems with stress and anxiety. About 6 months in I realized I had to get off of them. I was up to 3.5 mg dose of alprazolam (Xanax) to fall asleep at night. I figured, I\u2019m a tough person. I have a very strong will. I\u2019m just gonna stop taking these right now. And it\u2019s gonna be hard, but I will get through it. So I tried to go cold turkey one night and literally felt like i was losing my mind. Realized it would be impossible for me to do. So I started my journey. Tapering a little bit at a time. Every taper made me feel like I had a small case of the flu. Body aches, loss of appetite, etc. eventually after about 4-5 months of small tapers I was completely off of them. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. And I don\u2019t consider myself a weak person. I was just picking up my wife\u2019s prescription at the pharmacy today (not benzodiazepines) and heard a lady asking if her alprazolam would be available tomorrow. Wow. I now have a completely different perspective on benzodiazepines after my own experience. I actually felt bad for the lady. (Also: attempting to abruptly stop benzodiazepines is strongly not recommended. Especially if you are on a higher dose. A lot of literature says it could lead to seizures and other serious complications. A tapering process is the recommended approach. I was naive to think I could will myself off of them cold turkey. By that time I had a biological dependence on them. I was just ignorant.)", "My husband and I are recovering addicts. Both of us had a hard time getting away from our drug of choice.

I moved to xanax around 20. I didn't think you could have the serious withdrawals I repeatedly experienced for the next 20 years. Have been hospitalized more times than I can count for terrible seizures when withdrawaling. I took it as suggested on the bottle, never took huge amounts, my life was fantastic feeling like it helped me come out of my shell.. eventually it all became too much to continue though. I took them from age 17-32/33. I'm 36 now and considering I took them half my life, I believe it negatively impacted my entire brain development (socially, mainly) because I am not the person I was for all those years.

The saddest thing about it is how much I feel for people who have no idea that these terrible side effects are going to occur when they quit, especially from higher doses cold turkey, it's extremely dangerous. Some people that are very sensitive to it even get seizures from instantly quitting and die from it. I was abusing them because my doctor never told me that they were a big deal. Thank god I didn't slip for too long but I was abusing this substance for around 7 months.

I never did more than the 0.5mg. So it was easier for me to get off of than maybe those who abused daily\u2026 However learning to live with anxiety along with SSRI\u2019s was the only way to stay of them.

It has a super long half life and uses much larger mg dosing, which makes it way easier to lower the dose without side effects. 10-20mg Valium is equivalent to 1mg Klonopin (or I think 2mg Xanax, double check that there\u2019s a webmd conversion chart). I switched from 2.5mg Klonopin after a nightmarish experience of lowering from 3mg -> 2.5 to 40mg Valium and it made it so easy! It still took almost 2 years, but I was able to slowly lower the Valium by 2mg every 2 or so weeks until I got down to 0.5mg and then jumped off.

And he was taking care of her and scared to lose her. I think that's also a big thing that played into his sleeplessness and anxiety. So no wonder the doctor prescribed him a benzodiazepine. It's a real shame how some media outlets turned that into a narrative of Jordan being a drug addict who wouldn't know what he's talking about. Reading that stuff made me mad.

I know you can be better about that Jordan.", "I have observed peterson for a while and I deeply feel for him. I feel intellectually he is so agile, but he is at a wall of institution and his instinct is screaming for him to open a more shamanic or spiritual path - to go beyond that intellect. All these health problems sound a lot like kundalini awakening symptoms being misdiagnosed in a limited western construct of which he believes in and promotes to fix. I really feel he would benefit from some ceremonies and rituals involving plant medicine to break down that intellectual wall, that is both his force of creation and destruction as I can see. Great mind of our time, sad he hasn't fully found peace in himself. I hope he finds this.

Joe could have been easily easy going and be gracious with Jordan Peterson after all he went through and not having a podcast with him for a couple years. Instead Joe challenged Jordan many times in his thought process and awesome how Jordan didn't respond to him in an emotional way. Even though it may seem joe may be coming off emotional in his questions, it really was an example of two people who care about each other to be completely comfortable with each other and understand each other's views. I got my buttons pushed many times while listening to the conversation, picturing how I would react if whenever he was to cut me off.

Now knowing the context that already flimsy and shallow argument is even more weightless.  He didn't even get on it because of depression but anxiety and related health issues.  The way a lot of his detractors act borders on an instinctual and irrational fear of him they always bring up the benzos, they say his room is messy even though it isn't.  They make all these wild assertions about how his beliefs are simultaneously so crazy and baseless yet those same ideas are also so obvious and mundane nobody should be surprised by them.

Although, those who abuse it tend to have a more difficult time. But for people like me that have a need, I get worried that its abuse is going to restrict it so much that those that need it will suffer.

Jordan Peterson is a 100% humanist, and although I do not consider myself a humanist, that passion and that love that he shows for what the human being has created is immersive and I can empathize with it, because he knows how to transmit, that is a great talent. Being able to listen to someone with the ability to speak and structure his ideas in such a great way as he does is a privilege.

Bought his book. Binge watched his interviews for a good year back in 2018-2019. A LOT of what he said/says still holds up. Life changing advice. Tough but solid advice. He has a profound wisdom and the life/work experience to boot. Ever since his hospitalization though, the focus has shifted. Everything is about his condition and benzodiazepines. Like he's a celebrity. I mean, I don't understand why he's even indulging this subject so much. It's his private life. Is it to help people who take benzodiazepines? I mean... Ok... if that's the cause he's now choosing... but a LOT of people also don't touch those things. I'm pretty sure a large portion of his pre-established audience never even heard of them. I personally don't take any anti-depressants (and never will) nor any conscience altering substances except for coffee.... but now that's all we seem to be speaking about. Just before his hospitalization he would also talk more and more about his diet (which I completely disagree with and don't think it's what he's qualified to speak about. If carbohydrates were inherently bad or \"poisonous\" as he puts it, I'd be dead or dying... and so would a good portion of the French and Italian populations. My Italian grandfather ate almost nothing but bread and pasta his entire life. He's 104 now and still lucid. He's not even bed ridden. I was with him once during a medical exam when he had just turned 100. His doctor asked him what he ate that morning for breakfast and he simply replied \"a cookie\"... which is funny because that's exactly what JP said is the \"WORST\" thing you can eat for breakfast in an interview lol. The doctor then proceeded to give my grandfather a clean bill of health).\n\nI don't know. Don't get me wrong. I'm REALLY happy that he's okay... I'm happy for him and his family... but as far as his own private health issues go, I don't think he deserves any more attention than my sick aunt or anyone close to me. I don't care about JP on a personal level. I don't worship or love him... and I don't think anyone should either. You don't truly know him.

Your are a real treasure of our society .", "As someone who has been battling addiction for most of my life, the first thing I notice when I watch these clips is the physical toll that the last few years have given him. There's something in the eyes of addicts, or those affected my mental illness, and you you have to know it to see it... but there's something different in Jordan eyes. I think before his leave, there was some some sliver of light or innocence that he carried with him because he knew that despite all the public shaming, that he was doing the right thing. I think the toll of benzodiazepine use (which is an extremely dangerous drug to become dependent on, the withdrawal effects can last over a year) and all the ridicule has taken away that light in his eyes. \nHe looks incredibly hardened, tough, with glimpses of mania (probably induced by daily assassinations of his character just from speaking the truth or sharing his opinion).\n\nGod Bless You, Dr. Peterson. You've done so much for me. What can I do for you?", "If he were to start working out at the time he was facing ridicule, he would be able to manage the stress more easier, all of depression is in his mind & peeped out at times of highly (for him) inescapable stress, that\u2019s not depression disorder I think it\u2019s just him wanting a different life. Think having your tribe be at risk of attack from outside factors that causes stress & then depression when you realize it might not ever end if nobody strong fixes it. \nMy mom one time facing that type of stress lost all motion in her left side of her face but it lasted until her situation cleared. If depression was a disorder it\u2019d be there still when you\u2019re most at ease, peaceful & content with your life. Working out & eating right helps manage stress in huge way, allowing you to solve these problems (facing your tribe/yourself.) \nBut I definitely don\u2019t believe depression is genetic, rather a factor of your core beliefs, & not being at the vision of your desired life or the risk of that being taken away. \nPeople who aren\u2019t aligned to this develop depression until it becomes almost inescapable. If you can\u2019t be ok & present to the moment where your at now, working out will manage the stress, so you can fix the external situations that could cause depression, not being attached to what you have or what you want also fixes this, that\u2019s a muscle you have to develop in yourself.\n\nAs for dealing with people passing away or being the only person you know (not having a tribe), I don\u2019t know yet, maybe look at the people you have now, the life you have or the life you envision to have & then the beauty of the world, the possibilities & then work out and build the muscle of handling stress, go out and create the life you desire and life becomes way easier to achieve these levels. \nBecome the person strong enough to solve these problems, while not being negatively altered by them. That\u2019s strength. \nThat\u2019s what Dr. Peterson taught me, only half of it I gathered from other speakers and my own experience.", "This is weird.

My little brother wasn\u2019t even explained the side effects, and now he can\u2019t even get through a day without having an episode.\n\nAs much as doctors/psychiatrists want to convince you that taking a pill will be lead you to happiness, long term they usually end up causing way more harm than anything else.", "I was 17 when I got addicted to xans and I remember when I tried to quit cold turkey I was stuck in the boys bathroom at school with the worst diarrhea ever I thought I had dysentery.  Pleading with other people in the bathroom to bring me water.  I would give them money to get me a bottle from the vending machines and they would just steal the money.  Eventually the principal came in and in between shitstorms had me go to the bathroom in the nurses office where I was there for what seemed like forever.  A special needs student that was severely disabled was waiting to use the bathroom after me and I couldn\u2019t even get up to unlock the door never mind let him use it.  His aid was screaming at me to get out of the bathroom.  When I finally was able to leave the bathroom I just collapsed on the floor of nurses room and dry heaved and dry heaved so hard but nothing foam came out of my mouth.  I think the dry heaves had turned into seizures and the school realized the severity of the situation and called an ambulance.

It doesn\u2019t matter now. But the tapering does work for many even though it is a long, painful process and you have to go through the awful effects of tapering.  When i had akisthesia years ago, I had shock treatments and that stopped it.  I had 21.  But I didn\u2019t know about the benzos back then.  It took over 40 years on this medication before I learned I simply had to get off.  I had nine surgeries on my back neuropathy in my legs and feet. Turns out, it was never my back.

Some benzodiazepines like Xanax are for anxiety. Klonopin is for anxiety and seizures. Xanax has a shorter half life and is stronger. Klonopin is a 36 hour half life. Jordan is wrong about when benzodiazepines were marketed. Valium was released in the 60\u2019s. Joe covered this, my pharm tech teacher covered this. Books cover this. Also why is someone in that field quitting them cold turkey at his age?", "Damn, I literally stopped drinking a few weeks ago and stopped taking alprazolam.

I can't tell you how many times I have to deny people a benzodiazepine prescription and they get very upset with me. Still only use them in very limited situations. Can't completely take them out of the toolbox, but they definitely do more damage than good overall in the profession. They are often started in hospital due to convenience and then patients seek the prescription as an outpatient because they work so well early on. Very frustrating as an outpatient psychiatrist. Have to clean up the mess that hospital started.", "Not the biggest Jordan Peterson fan, but his honesty is very refreshing.", "I can relate, this is no joke, on one hand you cannot function due to illness and on the other the medication eventually worsens the problems, its addictive and kills you. At the same time there is the stigma, viewed as a weakness or fake, not seen as an actual disease. Meantime the mental capacity, reasoning, thinking differentiate us from vegetables. You can perform modified work even if the rest of your body is disabled as long your mental capacity is there but not the other way around.

And they work well for some people. But, everyone is different. Different body chemistry, different reactions. That class of meds are about the only thing I can take to reduce anxiety. While even the slightest taste of alcohol, like a sip of beer, will trigger severe panic attacks. For me, the withdrawals from SSRIs were way worse than when I stopped benzos. Not even close. Everyone reacts differently to different meds.", "I got off of Xanax and it was hell he's absolutely right,i almost died getting off of them", "Back in the 90\u2019s I went to a doctor asking if he could give me something for anxiety and he prescribed me Xanax. I had no idea what they were. Of course the anxiety stemed from my drinking. But I didnt know it at the time. Of course I started taking more than what was prescribed and of course I was mixing them with alcohol consumption. After a year of taking them I knew I an issue with them and tried to stop on my own. I couldn\u2019t stop. Long story short I ended up in a rehab. Thats when I found out it was very dangerous to stop cold turkey. They eased me off with some other drug that I cant recall. I will never forget the first night of withdrawing. I woke up soaking wet. I never sweated so much. It was hell for a few weeks. Probably took a good year to feel normal. I never ever had an urge to take them again.", "Obviously anything narcotic can be abused but benzos literally saved my life when tragedy struck, I only took them when I had to and I felt zero withdrawal after I didn't need them anymore, abusers shouldn't ruin medications for everyone but that's what always happens!!!", "Love Jordan. Wish him the absolue best.", "It sucks when you've got a thyroid disease and aren't allowed more natural sleep aids like melatonin. Since I was a kid, I've always had trouble sleeping and, like Dr. Peterson, I also have S.A.D. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in '14 and finally went into remission last year. Sadly, to deal with the anxiety that comes with hyperthyroidism, I asked to be put on Xanax and have been since the initial diagnosis. Drinking and taking Xanax have gone hand in hand that whole time for me. The longest I've gone without Xanax was last month because I was sick with \"you know what\" and was too fatigued to see my Dr. for a refill. I'm not sure if the withdrawal symptoms made it worse but they were minimal, thank God. Then, after regaining my energy, I felt my thyroid was screwed up again, so I got blood tests and a refill. Blood tests were normal and I did well with the pills for the 1st half of this month. 1 a day instead of 2. Then I started going downhill. Drinking more and taking more. I've been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for years and alienated almost all friends and family. Now I'm basically a shut in. I wouldn't wish it on anyone but it's nice to know that I'm not alone. I ordered a refill today (before I watched this video) and will, once again, start the process of tapering down. They haven't solved any problems. They've only created more through my blindness and stupidity.", "He never really talked about getting off of them\u2026 never heard of physical benzo withdrawal lasting for two years or even two months, but the metal side effects can linger for that long. Wish he would explain the details of getting off.", "I worked in pharmacies in the 1980s, and it was well known that these meds caused tolerance and dependence if used daily. I don't think they realized how difficult it could be to get off the drugs.\n\nHowever, I have used Xanax as needed (never more than once a day,  twice a week, usually less often) for more than 30 years without any tolerance or dependence. It is an extremely useful drug when used intermittently, depending on the patient. \n\nI go to doctors who do not prescribe benzos or psychiatric meds - you must go to a psychiatrist.", "I remember my uncle talking about how he had to get off the Xanax because of how it had affected his temper. He'd always had one, but some young fella cut him off and he sped up to block him off at a hairpin turn, way out in the country and pulled out his shotgun to get an apology out of the boy. Once he calmed down, though, it scared the shit out him, said that if that guy had given him any lip he would have absolutely shot him, he was that angry. He called his doctor that day and told him that he had to put him on something else. Once he was weaned off, he was fine, or least back to temper that he could control.", "Eight years later and I'm still not fully recovered. I was put on antidepressants for anxiety, they didn't help, but I couldn't get off them. Thirteen years later I tapered over 2 months and stopped, but got what gets called ' discontinuation syndrome'. My nervous system went into chaos and I was getting all kinds of weird symptoms. I started taking Xanax to help deal with that, but it made everything worse,  and eventually I couldn't sleep for more than a few seconds at a time. I had become dependent on the Xanax by then. It was another 2 years before I figured out what was going on and stopped taking it.  Five years mostly bed bound in absolute hell. I got akathisia and extreme sensitivity to everything. I was losing weight at a fast rate and a lot of my hair fell out, my teeth started getting loose and some of them fell out.  I tried going back on 2 different kinds of antidepressants, but they made me homicidal and then suicidal. These days I'm much better, I can function again, but I still get mild cycling symptoms like pain, feelings of dread and doom in the mornings, fatigue, tinnitus and endocrine disorders. I seem to have been left with a kind of CFS and FM type condition. I will never take any kind of psychiatric drug again, they may seem to help at first, but the price you pay in the long run isn't worth it", "You can tell Jordan is super uncomfortable... I was addicted to Klonopin for around a year following a sudden family death. I stopped cold turkey and had a seizure and had to go to the hospital. There is no worse feeling than Benzo withdraw. It literally feels like there is a grizzly bear in the room with you at all times. Imagine if you could somehow drink 100 cups of coffee.  It took around another year for my anxiety to go back down to baseline. Fuck these drugs, its better to just deal with the anxiety.", "It's not just an \"anti-anxiety\" pill Joe, it's a depressant, and absolutely will help you sleep.", "You can literally have seizures  from Xanax withdrawal.

I also suffer from insomnia due to anxiety, however, I was adamant against my doctors decision to put me on benzodiazepines, I instead opted for vaping marijuana, and all it takes is one small tiny puff at night before going to bed and it knocks me out every single time. I hope you find this information useful!", "I\u2019ve never done heroin.

For example, a rabbit that first sees a fox isn't spooked until he is attacked by a fox. Then when he sees a fox again, he has a panic set it. Similarly, semi trucks never gave me anxiety until one ran me off the road. Now whenever I see a semi, I get a slightly anxious response. Same with traumatic relationships.

I can totally relate to Jordan not being able to sleep. When you are going through an anxiety attack, you may wake up many times throughout the night in a puddle of sweat. Or you simply just can't sleep. Because your mind is racing. At first you totally don't understand what's going on with you. There were times I had to just go for a drive. Whether it was during the day, or the middle of the night. Because it helped ease my mind. Once you start to manage it better, it gets easier. But sometimes you're overwhelmed to the point to where you just aren't thinking clearly and you try to look for an escape. That escape could be drinking, or drugs. Or it could be what I used to do and go to various parks to hike, going to a school track to run, or simply going for a drive to try to calm down. Hats off to those who suffered the same way. I understand completely how you feel. At times you just want to live like it's your last day on earth. Because you feel so awful and miserable and like it could really be your last day on earth. Just keep moving forward, even if it's a crawl. When you look back, you'll be proud about how far you have came and what you overcame while having to suffer so much and it not defeating you.

If I didn't take medication, I'd have no quality of life. I have gone long periods of time without leaving my house. Now I have my dream job, relationships, and can even travel.  My case is extreme and I have to be careful and use what I need and when I need it. That's the thing with medication. People demonize it without fully understanding that it has its benefits for those who truly need it. Chronic problems have to be managed and people shouldn't have to fear judgment for things out of their control. It happens way too much. Even with pain medication.

Benzos are so supposed to be used only on a short-term basis. Clearly on the label. Unfortunately, too many Doctors put people on it for years. There are exceptions for a few people that may be indicated for long-term use whereby the benefits outweigh the risk. These are a minuscule amount of people. However, in most cases, it is not necessary. Emergency use in an E.R. setting or inpatient under tight supervision is justifiable. if prescribed by a clinic short-term no refills of the medication for cross-over treatment and quickly follow after 2 weeks if it keeps the patient out of the hospital then it is justified. The problem is long-term use in most cases the risk outweighs the benefits. In England, it is banned and the world has not fallen. There are other choices. In 27 years of practice never put anyone on long-term use. I certainly inherited people on it long term and it is very difficult to get them off. There is a lot of demonization of doctors for pushing it. However, most doctors are reluctant to prescribe it but too many prescribed it thoughtlessly. Many patients start asking for it immediately although you have met them for the first time. However, there are doctors that are negligent, unfortunately, and do not care. They do not justify the long-term use of it in their documents. I have seen more than I like. Sad. Solution banned them like England since it only really benefits a very small percentage of people and causes more harm than good in the long run.

Yes Trevor, he's not Black, Drake is not black and even Bernie Mac was not black, he was of African descent. If you think you're black, then you are still in chains. Take a good look at yourself, you're an African... that is none negotiable, but you're not black because it means you're accepting the label that \"white\" people gave you. Put anything with a color code #000000 next to your arm, unless your skin is black like the color black, then you're not black. There are no white people, only Caucasians, Italians, and so many other people... nobody is white in my eyes. I'm way darker than Trevor, in Rustenburg right now and both my parents are African and I don't even consider myself black. Joe is right man. This color shit is the reason why we don't like each other. If you think you're a white person, then you must be crazy unless your skin color matches that of a paper. Yes I said it, put a paper next to your arm and decide. Being a graphic designer opened my eyes about this. YOU ARE NOT BLACK BRO, you're an African. There's a huge difference! Stop calling people black or white, green, brown or whatever the fuck it is. We're all humans, Our noses are different, our hair, legs, pretty much everything about us is different but we don't classify any of it like we classify color. If you know your history, then you must be aware that labelling humans with different colors was started by racist people. Those who saw themselves as different and superior than others tend to label everyone below them as less or inferior colors. Imagine if noses were classified with shapes. Then people with square noses would be treated differently from people with triable noses or round noses. Whatever... the point is, the moment you stop classifying humans with color, is the moment you stop being a racist because the fact is, color is the only thing that defines our races and if we remove colors, then we remove all these different races and only left with one race, the human race. But let's be realistic... only Joe, myself and a handful of people like Morgan Freeman have been saying this for a long time. Call me black, and I'll show you the far end of your mother's holes because that would be offensive to me. I am not black, I'm an African. Have you seen what the color black looks like?

Overcoming \"Benozo\"  addiction is pretty close to the Top of the addiction mountain.  I was in Rehab with a few people who never touched illegal drugs. They were there because their Dr. Prescribed them Xanax at one point and gradually  increased it to a pretty high level then retired and Their new Dr's   wouldn't prescribe them the same amount or them at all and were forced to cut down and quit.

I've been on it 26 years and have no plans to get off it. F&$_ that.", "Something I'm passionate about is making the distinction between addiction and physical dependence, also the appalling lack of medication knowledge demonstrated by everyone besides pharmacists. \n\nWhenever I see anything come up about Peterson's issues with benzo withdrawal I see a lot of talk about addiction. Not all of it but a lot of it implies that Peterson was an addict. It's very important to understand that his experience and intentions were no different than when he was routinely prescribed an antidepressant, apart from the significantly worse withdrawal benzos produced. \n\nMany doctors treat benzos the same way as antidepressants, usually only somewhat questioning their prescribing if the patient is younger due to their vague understanding of addictive potential. For some reason many doctors are deluded into believing these drugs they've been prescribing for over 50 years don't cause the harm that they do. They like these drugs because they are easy fixes and make the patient happy quickly. The general protocol when dealing with someone who is suffering benzo withdrawal is that they are an addict or crazy. Further reinforcing that the drug is not the issue to both the doctor and patient. \n\nIt's important to understand the situations so many people find themselves in with medications, not just benzos. There is undoubtedly someone we all know that we could consider an addict or crazy. If people are demonized when really they are a victim of the system it's going to drive them to an even darker place than the medication has already put them in. \n\nIt's still not fair but Peterson can at least handle it, although I wouldn't doubt he \"contemplated\" based on the fact that his character was being so heavily misconstrued while his mind was in such a bad place. No doubt he disconnected from the media entirely at some points. Point is a lot of people wouldn't be able to cope with even normal gossip and would end it all. Particularly with these psych meds. Basically all psych meds have the potential to give you horrendous withdrawals and ruin you emotionally for a very long time. It's not like opioids where people mostly have the same experience. It's customised emotional and physical torture with psych meds based on your physiology and mental issues. It's uncommon to have reactions like Peterson's but more people than you would think go through some degree of unnecessary turmoil with meds, and I mean people who took them as prescribed. \n\nIn any case people should make sure they understand the topic and situation before making claims about others. It's important that people who suffer from meds receive the same support someone with mental health issues should receive. Getting through protracted withdrawal from any drug is hard, but with something that literally makes you go insane with so many varying mental and physical symptoms that are all agony in their own way you have zero chance of making it without support. You will either end up back on the drug, changing to another drug to smother symptoms or ending it all. I really do feel for those who do not have loving families or at least friends. The way they are often treated by practitioners and the general public is cruel when you understand what's really going on.  \n\nMost importantly doctors need to understand what they are prescribing. Over prescribing and misinterpretation of people's reactions to meds has been destroying people's mental/physical health for a while now, resulting in a cascade of new prescriptions to treat emerging symptoms from the previous prescription. \n\nWe all need to realise we don't need these meds more than half the time they try and give them to us. Doctors think we have significant mental problems that require medications way more than we actually do. Therapy, diet, exercise, career and relationship changes are often the answer and if not a lot of times a supplement like an adaptogen or things like GABA or Tryptophan can significantly help your mood. There's almost always a natural remedy for whatever you have, it's only when these things are ineffective that you should require a prescription and when you do go slow to gauge the benefit vs harm. For example someone who complains about their mild focus issues could take a great supplement called cognition support that actually improves general cognitive functioning for me and everyone I've given it too. But you could very easily see some idiot doctor saying \"oh you have ADD/ADHD take some Ritalin or Adderall that will permanently alter your dopamine pathways..\" btw no discredit to you if you do need meds because there's one I genuinely feel I need and it works well for me. \n\nEdit: I should give credit to the doctors who have recently learnt to dig deeper before prescribing because they are increasing. I know a few who have been great but usually it only goes as far as benzos and opioids. Still not much recognition of everything else, especially antidepressants and antipsychotics. It's a start but it seems like they generally only care when it's something that you mentally can't stop taking.", "Did anybody else find Joe Rogan to be quite rude and talking over his guest Jordan Peterson as he was trying to answer Joe rogan's questions?

Addiction is a compulsive and destructive behavior that seeks to soothe a deeper psychological problem with substances or other behaviors (legal and illegal drugs, shopping, eating, gambling, sex, porn, cleaning, micro managing, etc.)\n\nMeanwhile, chemical dependency is when someone\u2019s body become dependent on a substance or medication, but without the compulsion or destructive behavior. People can become chemically dependent on any medication and can have a hard time coming off of them, yet they don\u2019t seek to take more for pleasure or self destruction. A person can hit tolerance and start having symptoms, which means that the dose of that medication is not working anymore, so the doctor has to increase the dose so the person can get relief from the symptoms again. And usually that\u2019s a bad sign that means the medication is causing harm and it will poop out eventually, which means is time to get off of it slowly by tapering properly. \n\nI\u2019m a survivor of an iatrogenic injury caused by a benzo that I got prescribed for a legitimate health issue and I only took it PRN for two weeks before reaching tolerance, and also an antidepressant that was prescribed to counteract the horrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms of the benzo, which at end just worsen my situation. \nIt took me 14 months to taper off of the benzo, and I\u2019m still tapering the AD. One has to taper slowly in order to avoid major shock to the nervous system and avoid permanent damage or death. \n\nAnd Joe is correct when he said Benzos are the most dangerous meds in the world\u2026even worst than opioids. At least people can taper opioids fast and the withdrawal symptoms don\u2019t last as long and people can recover quite fast from them unlike Benzos and antidepressants. \n\nUnethical doctors and pharma are pretty much committing legalized genocide. Killing millions of people with prescribed medications that are extremely harmful and that in reality they don\u2019t need.\n\nP.S. \nI belong to several Benzos and AD support groups and this happens to millions of people, but the big majority of folks don\u2019t realize is the meds what\u2019s causing them the \u201cunknown\u201d health problems, and doctors gaslight people into thinking that is not the meds.

He did go missing a few weeks beforehand and I put up a Facebook post in 2015 leaving people know and stuff that that was the case and my uncles friend saw him in Killarney County Kerry and I rang The Laune B and B in Killarney and the guy at the desk said he was there and was fine.

He could never really say no either when people would ask him for a free one and that just led him down a difficult path I think.

They are both equally addictive and hard as hell to quit. I know just as many people or more addicted to Xanax than pain killers.  2. I am pretty sure the chemical compound of Xanax and probably all benzos are not meant for what it is prescribed for.  It  only creates bigger problems.  If the scientist who made this drug have no idea about how anxiety really works and when they did mice studies they discovered it only made the mice more anxious, it does not work.  Now with all that said, having an anxiety/panic disorder I understand both sides, so no need to argue. Just facts and trying to seek solutions, although most people who want to argue are the ones who justify taking these unhelpful highly addictive drugs.

What it is about Xanax that make people shoplift crazy stuff from Walmart in the middle of the night I have no idea but they do it. Anyway I as a guitarist wanted Jimi Hendrix drugs and found a Dr. who would prescribe them. Seconal was my favorite drug ever. I knew more than 2 could kill me so I rarely took more but I drank, smoked pot, did coke ect all at the same time while performing 6 nights a week for decades. I took every last one in a 200 mile radius when they discontinued them. I'd take 2 Demerol/phenergan combo one night, 2 Seconal the next for years. I was mentally hooked but not physically. When both of those drugs were discontinued they started pushing this oxy thing really hard and then I did become hardcore addicted doing over 300 mg a day and 6-10 Soma. I'm on Suboxone strips now and things seem okay but I know they are not. If I were to stop taking strips I would definitely go into hardcore withdrawal. I have not slept in 10 years without taking an Ambien. About 5 years ago I suffered a spinal cord injury that cost me my ability to play guitar well or even walk well. Recently I've begun to play again and due to play at my first major concert (Major for me) since r injury. I had to relearn how to put the guitar. With all this said I consider myself lucky to be alive with a great family. I'm certainly doing better than half of my friends who are all dead.

Some will try to harm and some will try to help, but it's unclear who can even do what. Peterson talks about Psychiatry, that can help, but if your shrink looks only to apply a textbook method, he might dose you with a drug to relieve certain symptoms, which generates for him a predictable and controllable behavior but leaves you, the patient, no better for it. Your recovery I would argue then is severely compromised, because what happens when the fog lifts?\n\nUnpleasant as it may be, once your mind recovers, it like your muscles, recovers strengthened and more resilient, the first time this happens is comparable to a full reset, your mind goes from candle to light-bulb except now you realize you're floating and that the fog was hiding a storm that took out or damaged your foundations.These foundations are the story of yourself and the world that you've settled your mind into all your life.\n\nThis gives you an opportunity, mind you more of an obligation. To rebuild or repair them as you see fit, the chance in that mind-frame is you get to rearrange or disencumber yourself as you see fit. The danger there is who you let influence this reconstruction, and that goes as much for your shrink as it does for social mores and your own emotions. Many people will walk in and try to install their own control sources within your mind. Society arguably does that to us all initially. Certainly many of these people seem blissfully unaware of the ones others have seeded within them.\n\nBut the point is that this represents the first threshold in yourlife where the automatic process of your sense-of-self goes from mechanical automatism, to (at least potentially) conscious and aware. This is perhaps the best representation, in this game when a hero's stress gauge fills up, they either develop a virtue or an affliction.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjw4HCSSf0I\n\nPS None of these involve a goddamn shrink dosing you", "It's great to see Jordan on Joe Rogan, I will say it's quite surprising how Joe is a little unself-aware.
